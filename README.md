## Overview

The **Agricultural Data Analysis Platform** is a data-driven project focused on analyzing coffee growth trends in Uganda. By leveraging data science and machine learning, the platform aims to provide insights into coffee production to help support sustainable farming practices. This platform offers a range of tools for visualizing data, predicting crop yield, and understanding environmental impact.

## Features

- **Data Collection**: Pulls historical and current data on coffee growth, weather patterns, and soil conditions.
- **Data Processing**: Cleans and preprocesses data for more accurate analysis.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Uses machine learning models to predict coffee yields based on environmental factors.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Provides a user-friendly interface with graphs, charts, and maps to illustrate key data insights.
- **Sustainable Farming Insights**: Offers tailored recommendations to support sustainable agricultural practices.

## Technology Stack

- **Python**: Primary language for data processing, machine learning, and data visualization.
- **R** (optional): For statistical analysis and data visualization.
- **JavaScript**: For interactive web-based visualizations, using libraries like D3.js or Plotly.
- **HTML/CSS**: Structure and styling for the web-based interface.
- **Flask** or **Django**: Backend framework for web application functionality.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Interactive notebooks for exploratory data analysis and model development.

## Setup Instructions

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/agricultural-data-analysis-platform.git
cd agricultural-data-analysis-platform
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Data Preparation

Place raw datasets in the `data/raw/` directory.  
Run the `data_processing.py` script to clean and preprocess the data:

```bash
python src/data_processing.py
```

### Model Training

Use the `model_training.py` script to train and evaluate the models:

```bash
python src/model_training.py
```

### Run the Web Application

Start the web application to access interactive visualizations:

```bash
python web_app/app.py
```

Open the application in your browser at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

## Usage

The platform provides the following functionalities:

- **Data Insights**: View graphs and charts illustrating trends in coffee growth and yield.
- **Yield Prediction**: Use predictive models to estimate future yields based on weather and soil data.
- **Sustainable Farming Recommendations**: Explore suggestions for sustainable farming practices that can be implemented to maximize yield while maintaining environmental integrity.
